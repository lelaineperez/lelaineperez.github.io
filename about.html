  <section class="about-content">
    <p>
      I’m a Digital Project Manager with a strong interest in creative production spaces,
      particularly games, toys, and film. I’m drawn to roles where I can support creative
      teams by bringing clarity, organization, and momentum to projects without disrupting
      the creative process.
    </p>

    <p>
      With a technical background, I’m comfortable collaborating across disciplines and
      adapting quickly to new tools and workflows. I enjoy wearing many hats—whether that
      means coordinating timelines, managing documentation, facilitating communication,
      or stepping in wherever a project needs support.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m currently focused on building hands-on experience managing collaborative projects,
      refining workflows, and learning how creative teams operate at different stages of
      production. My goal is to grow as a project manager within creative industries where
      technology, storytelling, and teamwork come together to create meaningful experiences.

    <h3>My Project Management Style</h3>
    <p>
      I see project management as a support role first. My approach focuses on creating
      structure that empowers creative teams rather than limiting them. I value flexibility,
      communication, and collaboration, and I’m most effective when I can help teams stay
      aligned while adapting to changing project needs.
