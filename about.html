    <!-- ABOUT NARRATIVE -->
    <section class="about-content">
      <p>
        I began my journey as a Computer Science major, exploring technology and systems, but I quickly realized I wanted a career that combined creativity with structure. That led me to project management, where I can use my technical understanding to support creative teams while fueling the imaginative industries I love.
      </p>

      <p>
        My dream is to work in creative industries, specifically games, toys, and film. Spaces where storytelling, play, and innovation come together. Project management in these industries allows me to bridge the gap between creativity and execution, keeping projects on track without stifling the vision of the team.
      </p>

      <p>
        I thrive on wearing many hats: coordinating timelines, managing documentation, facilitating communication, and stepping in wherever the project needs support. I enjoy learning new tools, adapting workflows, and continuously refining processes to help teams work efficiently while keeping creativity at the forefront.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I’m building hands-on experience managing collaborative projects, understanding production pipelines, and learning how creative teams operate at different stages of development. My goal is to grow as a project manager in spaces where technology, storytelling, and play converge to create meaningful experiences.
