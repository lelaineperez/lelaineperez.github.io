  <section class="about-content">
    <p>
      I began my undergraduate journey in 2021 as a Computer Science major, exploring technology and systems to become a software engineer. Computer Science is what I pursued in highschool and had the intention to continue a CS career in college, until over time, I realized that while I enjoyed understanding how things worked in technology, I wanted a career that combined creativity with structure. This led me to project management, where I can leverage my technical background to support teams while contributing to the imaginative industries I love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through networking with organizations such as Women In Toys, Licensing, and entertainment, I developed the dream to work in creative industries, specifically games, toys, and film. Where storytelling, play, and innovation come together. Pursuing project management in these spaces allows me to bridge the gap between creativity and execution, keeping projects on track while empowering teams to bring their vision to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thrive in roles where organization is key, such as balancing timelines, documentation, and communication while stepping in wherever a project needs support. I enjoy learning new tools and adapting to different workflows, overall refining processes to help teams work effectively without limiting thier creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I’m working on building hands-on experience managing collaborative projects, understanding production pipelines, and learning how creative teams operate at different stages of development. I’m excited to continue growing as a project manager in creative industries and helping teams turn bold ideas into meaningful experiences. If you’re looking for someone who can bridge creativity and execution while keeping projects on track, let’s connect!

    <h3>My Project Management Style</h3>
    <p>
      To me, project management is a support role first. My approach focuses on creating a structure that empowers creative teams rather than limiting them to give them the space for creative ideation. I value flexibility, communication, and collaboration, and I’m most effective when I can help teams stay aligned while adapting to changing project needs.
