  <section class="about-content">
    <p>
      I began my undergraduate journey as a Computer Science major, exploring technology and systems to become a software engineer. Over time, I realized that while I enjoyed understanding how things worked, I wanted a career that combined creativity with structure. This led me to project management, where I can leverage my technical background to support teams while contributing to the imaginative industries I love.
    </p>
    <p>
      My dream is to work in creative industries, specifically games, toys, and film. Where storytelling, play, and innovation come together. Project management in these spaces allows me to bridge the gap between creativity and execution, keeping projects on track while empowering teams to bring their vision to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thrive in versatile roles, balancing timelines, documentation, and communication while stepping in wherever a project needs support. I embrace learning new tools and adapting workflows, continuously refining processes to help teams work effectively without limiting creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I’m building hands-on experience managing collaborative projects, understanding production pipelines, and learning how creative teams operate at different stages of development. I’m excited to continue growing as a project manager in creative industries, helping teams turn bold ideas into meaningful experiences. If you’re looking for someone who can bridge creativity and execution while keeping projects on track, let’s connect and see how I can support your next project.

    <h3>My Project Management Style</h3>
    <p>
      I see project management as a support role first. My approach focuses on creating a structure that empowers creative teams rather than limiting them. I value flexibility, communication, and collaboration, and I’m most effective when I can help teams stay aligned while adapting to changing project needs.
